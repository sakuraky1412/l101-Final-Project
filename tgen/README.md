TGen
====

*A statistical natural language generator for spoken dialogue systems*

TGen is a statistical natural language generator, with two different algorithms supported:

1. A statistical sentence planner based on A*-style search, with a candidate plan generator and a perceptron ranker
2. A sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) recurrent neural network architecture based on the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) toolkit

Both algoritms can be trained from pairs of source meaning representations (dialogue acts) and target sentences.
The newer seq2seq approach is preferrable: it yields higher performance in terms of both speed and quality.

Both algorithms support generating sentence plans (deep syntax trees), which are subsequently converted to text using the existing the surface realizer from [Treex NLP toolkit](http://ufal.cz/treex).
The seq2seq algorithm also supports direct string generation.

For more details on the algorithms, please refer to our papers:
* For seq2seq generation, see our [ACL 2016 paper](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P16-2008).
* For an improved version of the seq2seq generation that takes previous user utterance into account to generate a more contextually-appropriate response, see our [SIGDIAL 2016 paper](http://www.sigdial.org/workshops/conference17/proceedings/pdf/SIGDIAL22.pdf).
* For the old A*-search-based generation, see our [ACL 2015 paper](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P15/P15-1044.pdf).

Installation and Usage
----------------------

Please refer to [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for instructions on how to use TGen.

Notice
------

* TGen is highly experimental and only tested on a few datasets, so bugs are inevitable. If you find a bug, feel free to [contact me](https://github.com/tuetschek) or [open an issue](https://github.com/UFAL-DSG/tgen/issues).
* If you do not require a specific version of TGen, we recommended to install the current master version, which has the latest bugfixes and all the functionality of the ACL2016/SIGDIAL2016 version.
  * To get the version used in our ACL 2015 paper (A*-search only), see [this release](https://github.com/UFAL-DSG/tgen/releases/tag/ACL2015).
  * To get the version used in our ACL 2016 and SIGDIAL 2016 papers (seq2seq approach for generating sentence plans or strings, optionally using previous context), see [this release](https://github.com/UFAL-DSG/tgen/releases/tag/ACL2016).
